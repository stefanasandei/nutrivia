# Data Layer

The data is stored on a PostgreSQL database. The database requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties.

Row-Level security is used to restrict data access to only the users with the appropriate read/write permissions.
